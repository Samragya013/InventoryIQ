## Problem Statement

Retail managers face uncertainty when deciding how much inventory to order due to fluctuating demand.
This leads to overstocking (increased holding costs) or stockouts (lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction).

This MVP aims to provide data-backed inventory order recommendations based on historical sales trends,
helping business stakeholders make confident, cost-efficient ordering decisions.
